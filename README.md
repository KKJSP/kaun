# Kaun!

A quick way to decide who goes first, who gets picked, or how to group. Whether you're starting a
game night or splitting teams â€” just gather around and let Kaun! do the choosing.

It is inspired by Chwazi. It solves one of the limitations of Chwazi that our group often
encountered - selecting an order of play. It also implements the options from Chwazi - selecting
one, and grouping. It was an experiment to test the limits of the latest LLM models. This particular
one was entirely created by Gemini 2.5 pro.
