# [Kaun!](https://kkjsp.github.io/kaun/)

A quick way to decide who goes first, who gets picked, or how to group. Whether you're starting a
game night or splitting teams â€” just gather around and let Kaun! do the choosing.

It is inspired by Chwazi and solves one of its limitations that was often encountered - selecting
an order of play. It also implements the options from Chwazi - selecting one, and grouping. It was
an experiment to test the limits of the latest LLM models. This particular one was entirely created
by Gemini 2.5 pro.
